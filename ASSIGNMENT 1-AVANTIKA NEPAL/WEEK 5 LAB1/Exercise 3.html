    <p>Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet. 
        It usually refers to the user experience aspects of website development rather 
        than software development. Web design used to be focused on designing websites 
        for desktop browsers; however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and tablet
         browsers has become ever-increasingly important.</p><br>
